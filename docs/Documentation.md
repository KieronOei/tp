**Setting up and maintaining the project website:**

* We use [**MarkBind**](https://markbind.org/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder contains the source files for the documentation website.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Working with Forked MarkBind sites](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind-forked-sites.html) for project documentation.
* If you are using Intellij for editing documentation files, you can consider enabling 'soft wrapping' for `*.md` files, as explained in [_[se-edu/guides] **Intellij IDEA: Useful settings**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijUsefulSettings.html#enabling-soft-wrapping)


**Style guidance:**
